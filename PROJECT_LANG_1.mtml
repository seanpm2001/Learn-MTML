<p>Project language file 1</p>
<p>For: seanpm2001/Learn-MTML</p>
<p>About:</p>
<p>I decided to make MTML the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-MTML) as MTML is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the MTML programming language. It only makes sense to MTML the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.</p>
